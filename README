Hello Glass is a very basic application written for Google Glass.

It's voice trigger is "Hello Glass" and it displays a card to say "Hello, Glass Class, .. welcome to a 16z".

I strongly recommend looking at Google's official documentation - https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/

[Changelog]
